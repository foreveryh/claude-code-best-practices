- [ ] **IDENTIFY EVERY IMAGE** including charts, diagrams, GIFs, screenshots
- [ ] **CREATE IMAGE DIRECTORY**: `public/images/[article-slug]/`
- [ ] **DOWNLOAD ALL IMAGES** to local directory
- [ ] **UPDATE ALL IMAGE PATHS** from external URLs to local paths
- [ ] **VERIFY IMAGE ACCESS** - test every image displays correctly

npm run dev
# Check: Images display, content reads naturally, formatting intact
```
