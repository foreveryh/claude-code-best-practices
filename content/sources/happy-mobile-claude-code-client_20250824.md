### Step 2: Install CLI on your computer

[](https://github.com/slopus/happy#step-2-install-cli-on-your-computer)

undefinedshell
npm install -g happy-coder
undefined

### Step 3: Start using `happy` instead of `claude`

[](https://github.com/slopus/happy#step-3-start-using-happy-instead-of-claude)

undefinedshell
# Instead of claude, just run happy

happy

undefined

How does it work?
-----------------

[](https://github.com/slopus/happy#how-does-it-work)

On your computer, run `happy` instead of `claude` to start the normal Claude Code UI through our wrapper. When you want to control Claude from your phone, it restarts the session in remote mode. To switch back to your computer, just press any key on your keyboard.

🔥 Why Happy Coder?
-------------------

[](https://github.com/slopus/happy#-why-happy-coder)

*   📱 **Mobile access to Claude Code** - Check what Claude is building while away from your desk
*   🔔 **Push notifications** - Get alerted when Claude needs permission or encounters errors
*   ⚡ **Switch devices instantly** - Take control from phone or desktop with one keypress
*   🔐 **End-to-end encrypted** - Your code never leaves your devices unencrypted
*   🛠️ **Open source** - Audit the code yourself. No telemetry, no tracking

📦 Project Components
---------------------

[](https://github.com/slopus/happy#-project-components)

*   **[happy-cli](https://github.com/slopus/happy-cli)** - Command-line interface for Claude Code
*   **[happy-server](https://github.com/slopus/happy-server)** - Backend server for encrypted sync
*   **happy-coder** - This mobile client (you are here)

🏠 Who We Are
-------------

[](https://github.com/slopus/happy#-who-we-are)

We're engineers scattered across Bay Area coffee shops and hacker houses, constantly checking how Claude is progressing on our pet projects during lunch breaks. Happy Coder was born from the frustration of not being able to peek at Claude building our side hustles while we're away from our keyboards. We believe the best tools come from scratching your own itch and sharing with the community.
