### üîí Security & Privacy
- **End-to-end encryption** - Messages encrypted between your devices

- **Open source** - MIT licensed, auditable codebase
- **Local processing** - Runs on your hardware

### üéôÔ∏è Voice Control

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

Happy uses a three-component architecture:

### 1. CLI Program (`happy`)
```bash
npm install -g happy-coder
happy
```

The CLI runs on your computer, wrapping Claude Code and encrypting session data before sending it to the relay server.

### 2. Mobile/Web App
The client apps receive encrypted data from the server and provide the interface for monitoring and controlling Claude Code sessions.

### 3. Relay Server
A secure server that passes encrypted messages between your computer and mobile devices without being able to read the content.

## üì¶ Quick Start

### Step 1: Install CLI
```bash
npm install -g happy-coder
```

### Step 2: Download Mobile App
- [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/happy-claude-code-client/id6748571505)
- [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ex3ndr.happy)
- [Web App](https://app.happy.engineering/)

### Step 3: Start Using
```bash
# Instead of 'claude', run 'happy'
happy
```
