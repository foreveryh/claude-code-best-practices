# Happy: Mobile and Web Client for Claude Code

> **‚≠ê GitHub**: [slopus/happy](https://github.com/slopus/happy) (466 stars)

Happy is a revolutionary mobile and web client that extends Claude Code beyond your desktop, enabling you to access, monitor, and control your AI coding sessions from anywhere. With end-to-end encryption, voice control, and multi-session support, Happy transforms how developers interact with Claude Code.

## üöÄ What is Happy?

Happy is an open-source solution that allows you to:

- **Access Claude Code on mobile** - iOS, Android, and web platforms
- **Control multiple sessions** - Run several Claude Code instances simultaneously
- **Voice interaction** - Hands-free coding with real-time voice execution
- **End-to-end encryption** - Your code never leaves your devices unencrypted
- **Zero workflow disruption** - Works with your existing tools and environments

## üéØ Key Features

### üì± Multi-Platform Access
- **iOS App**: [Download from App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/happy-claude-code-client/id6748571505)
- **Android App**: [Download from Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ex3ndr.happy)
- **Web App**: [Launch Web App](https://app.happy.engineering/)
- **Desktop**: Works seamlessly with your existing Claude Code setup

### üîí Security & Privacy
- **End-to-end encryption** - Messages encrypted between your devices
- **No telemetry or tracking** - Your data stays private
- **Open source** - MIT licensed, auditable codebase
- **Local processing** - Runs on your hardware

### üéôÔ∏è Voice Control
- **Real-time voice execution** - Speak commands and watch them execute
- **Hands-free coding** - True voice-to-action, not just transcription
- **Voice agent** - Advanced voice interaction beyond simple dictation

### üîÑ Multi-Session Management
- **Parallel sessions** - Run multiple Claude Code instances
- **Context switching** - Switch between frontend, backend, and DevOps tasks
- **Session continuity** - Resume sessions across devices
- **Smart notifications** - Get alerted when input is needed

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

Happy uses a three-component architecture:

### 1. CLI Program (`happy`)
```bash
npm install -g happy-coder
happy
```

The CLI runs on your computer, wrapping Claude Code and encrypting session data before sending it to the relay server.

### 2. Mobile/Web App
The client apps receive encrypted data from the server and provide the interface for monitoring and controlling Claude Code sessions.

### 3. Relay Server
A secure server that passes encrypted messages between your computer and mobile devices without being able to read the content.

## üì¶ Quick Start

### Step 1: Install CLI
```bash
npm install -g happy-coder
```

### Step 2: Download Mobile App
- [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/happy-claude-code-client/id6748571505)
- [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ex3ndr.happy)
- [Web App](https://app.happy.engineering/)

### Step 3: Start Using
```bash
# Instead of 'claude', run 'happy'
happy
```
