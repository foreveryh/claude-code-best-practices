# Best Practices

## Common Best Practices (ranked by community frequency)

- **CLAUDE.md and memory**: Maintain concise `CLAUDE.md` at repo root (and subfolders/home). Use `#` to capture commands, patterns, and rules the model should follow.
- **Plan before coding**: Ask Claude to research and propose a plan (Explore → Plan → Code → Commit). Use extended thinking ("think hard/ultrathink") and avoid one-shot mega prompts.
- **Keep context focused**: Use `/clear` between tasks, start fresh sessions per task, and `/compact` at natural breakpoints.
- **Tests first, human-written**: Prefer TDD. Run tests/typecheck/lint after small edits. Do not let AI write or modify test expectations for critical areas.
- **Safety and permissions**: Configure allowlists; use auto-accept sparingly. YOLO (`--dangerously-skip-permissions`) only in constrained environments with backups.
- **Be specific and reference context**: State exact requirements, edge cases, and success criteria; reference files; attach images/URLs when relevant.
- **Iterate in small steps**: Stage early and often, interrupt to course-correct, undo when needed, and avoid large, hard-to-review diffs.
- **Parallelize with subagents and worktrees**: Use Task/subagents, multiple Claude instances, multiple checkouts or git worktrees for independent tasks.
- **Customize your setup**: Create custom slash commands and hooks; fine-tune `.claude/settings.json`; install `gh` CLI; enable IDE/terminal integrations.
- **Use Claude for git/GitHub**: Generate commits/PRs, fix failing builds, triage issues, and handle complex git flows via guided commands.
- **Headless/CI automation**: Use headless mode in scripts and CI to lint, triage, or run structured workflows.
- **Respect "never-touch" zones**: Keep migrations, API contracts, secrets, and security-critical code under human control with explicit boundaries.
