# FradSer: Trust the /init Command

## Overview

Based on extensive experience with Claude Code, community expert FradSer shares practical strategies that go beyond official documentation to maximize your development efficiency and code quality.

## Core Principles

### 1. Trust the `/init` Command

**Always believe in `/init`** - Regularly use the `/init` command to keep your `CLAUDE.md` updated to its optimal state. For important features, create `CLAUDE.md` files in subfolders to maintain context and best practices at every level.

**Why it works:**
- Keeps your project context fresh and relevant
- Ensures Claude Code has the latest information about your codebase
- Maintains consistency across different project areas

### 2. Embrace Full Permissions

**Be bold with permissions** - When you don't have production environment concerns, use `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` to grant full permissions. This eliminates unnecessary restrictions and allows Claude Code to work at maximum efficiency.

**When to use:**
- Development environments
- Local testing scenarios
- When you need maximum flexibility
- Prototyping and experimentation

### 3. Commit Frequently

**Git commit...commit...commit** - Never think you're committing too much. Frequent commits create a clear history, make debugging easier, and provide safe rollback points.

**Benefits:**
- Clear development timeline
- Easy bug tracking and bisection
- Safe experimentation with rollback capability
- Better collaboration with team members

### 4. Leverage Git Worktree with Git Flow

**Use git worktree with git flow** - This combination significantly reduces the mental overhead of complex Git operations. Git worktree allows you to work on multiple branches simultaneously, while git flow provides a structured branching strategy.

**Setup example:**
```bash
# Create a new feature branch with worktree
git worktree add -b feature/new-feature ../new-feature-branch main

# Work on the feature
cd ../new-feature-branch
# Make changes, commit frequently

# When ready, merge back
git checkout main
git merge feature/new-feature
git worktree remove ../new-feature-branch
```

### 5. Use ESC Liberally

**Press ESC often** - If something doesn't feel right, don't hesitate to adjust course. The ESC key is your friend for:
- Canceling operations that aren't going well
- Resetting context when needed
- Starting fresh when you're stuck
- Maintaining control over your workflow

### 6. Essential Sub-Agents

**Always include these sub-agents in your setup:**

#### Tech Lead
- **Purpose**: Design long-term architectural goals
- **Benefit**: Prevents architectural chaos
- **Focus**: System design, scalability, maintainability

#### UX Reviewer
- **Purpose**: Check for user experience design issues
- **Benefit**: Improves accessibility and user satisfaction
- **Example**: Swift projects with significant a11y optimizations

#### Code Simplifier
- **Purpose**: Prevent code over-engineering
- **Priority**: **First priority** - use this agent before others
- **Benefit**: Keeps codebase clean and maintainable

## Implementation Strategy

### Setting Up Your Environment

1. **Initialize with `/init`**
   ```bash
   # In your project root
   claude /init
   ```

2. **Create subfolder documentation**
   ```bash
   # For important features
   mkdir feature-name
   cd feature-name
   echo "# Feature Documentation" > CLAUDE.md
   ```

3. **Configure permissions**
   ```bash
   # For development environments
   claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
   ```

### Workflow Integration

1. **Start each session with `/init`**
2. **Commit after every significant change**
3. **Use ESC to reset when needed**
4. **Always run Code Simplifier first**
5. **Review with UX Reviewer for user-facing changes**
6. **Consult Tech Lead for architectural decisions**

## Advanced Tips

### Git Worktree Best Practices

```bash
# Create a worktree for a new feature
git worktree add -b feature/user-auth ../auth-feature main

# Work on the feature
cd ../auth-feature
# Make changes, commit frequently

# When ready to merge
git checkout main
git merge feature/user-auth
git worktree remove ../auth-feature
```

### Sub-Agent Priority Order

1. **Code Simplifier** - Always run first
2. **Tech Lead** - For architectural decisions
3. **UX Reviewer** - For user-facing features
4. **Other specialized agents** - As needed

### Context Management

- Use `CLAUDE.md` files strategically
- Update context regularly with `/init`
- Keep documentation close to code
- Maintain separate contexts for different features

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### ❌ Don't Skip `/init`
- **Problem**: Outdated context leads to poor suggestions
- **Solution**: Regular `/init` usage

### ❌ Don't Fear Frequent Commits
- **Problem**: Large commits make debugging difficult
- **Solution**: Commit early, commit often

### ❌ Don't Ignore ESC
- **Problem**: Stuck in unproductive workflows
- **Solution**: Use ESC to reset and try again

### ❌ Don't Skip Code Simplifier
- **Problem**: Over-engineered, complex code
- **Solution**: Always run Code Simplifier first

## Success Metrics

Track these indicators to measure your Claude Code effectiveness:

- **Reduced debugging time** - Frequent commits help
- **Cleaner codebase** - Code Simplifier results
- **Better user experience** - UX Reviewer improvements
- **Consistent architecture** - Tech Lead guidance
- **Faster development cycles** - Optimized workflow

## Conclusion

These community-tested practices from FradSer provide a solid foundation for maximizing Claude Code's effectiveness. The key is to:

1. **Trust the tools** - Use `/init` and full permissions when appropriate
2. **Stay organized** - Commit frequently and use git worktree
3. **Stay flexible** - Use ESC to adjust course when needed
4. **Prioritize quality** - Always start with Code Simplifier

By following these practices, you'll create a more efficient, maintainable, and enjoyable development experience with Claude Code.
