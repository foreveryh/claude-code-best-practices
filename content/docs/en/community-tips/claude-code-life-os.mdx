## Original Prompts

### Weekly Check-in Prompt

**for weekly checkin:**

```markdown
Create a smart weekly check-in system that automatically discovers
what metrics to track based on my project context.

Step 1: Create the directory structure
mkdir -p .claude/commands
mkdir -p .claude/subagents
mkdir -p metrics

Step 2: Create the slash command at
.claude/commands/weekly-checkin.md:

# Weekly Check-in

Perform a comprehensive weekly check-in by:

1. First, analyze the entire project context:
    - Read [CLAUDE.md](http://claude.md/) to understand the user and their projects
    - Scan any business/, docs/, or similar folders for context
    - Look for existing metrics history to understand what's been
    tracked
    - Identify what type of work/business this is
2. Based on your analysis, determine the most relevant metrics to
track. For example:
    - Creators: followers, subscribers, views, revenue
    - SaaS: MRR, users, churn, growth rate
    - Developers: commits, PRs, stars, downloads
    - Students: courses completed, grades, projects
3. Ask for current metrics using the specific metrics YOU
discovered from context
4. After receiving data:
    - Read previous week from `/metrics/metrics-history.md` if it
    exists
    - Update metrics history with new data
    - Launch metrics-analyst subagent for analysis
    - Save report to `/metrics/weekly-report-YYYY-MM-DD.md`

IMPORTANT: Do NOT use generic templates. Discover what's relevant
for THIS specific user.

Step 3: Create the metrics analyst subagent at
.claude/subagents/metrics-analyst.md:

# Metrics Analyst Subagent

You are an expert at analyzing progress metrics. Create visual,
actionable insights.

## Instructions:

1. Create beautiful markdown tables comparing current vs previous
metrics
2. Calculate growth percentages and trends
3. Use visual indicators: üöÄ (>20% growth), üìà (positive), üìâ
(negative), ‚û°Ô∏è (flat)
4. Generate ASCII progress bars for goals
5. Provide 3-5 specific, actionable recommendations
6. Make the report visually appealing and encouraging

Focus on progress and actionable next steps.

Step 4: Create initial metrics history at
metrics/metrics-history.md:

# Metrics History

{/* Automatically updated by weekly check-ins */}

Step 5: Add to [CLAUDE.md](http://claude.md/):

## Weekly Check-In Protocol

The `/weekly-checkin` command will:

1. Analyze project context to determine relevant metrics
2. Ask for current values of those specific metrics
3. Compare to previous data and generate visual analysis
4. Save formatted report with insights and recommendations

The system intelligently adapts to track what matters for this
specific project.

HOW IT WORKS:

- Claude reads your entire project context FIRST
- Figures out what you do and what metrics matter to YOU
- Asks for those specific metrics (not generic templates)
- Creates beautiful visual reports with week-over-week tracking

The intelligence is in the discovery - it adapts to each user
automatically.
```
